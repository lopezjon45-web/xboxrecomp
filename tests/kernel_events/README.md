# Kernel events

KEVENTs a title builds by writing the header itself, with no
`KeInitializeEvent` call, checked through the thunk dispatcher. Like
`tests/memory_regressions`, it needs no title and no game files: it runs the
real memory layout on the small synthetic XBE from `tools/conformance`.

```
cmake -S tests/kernel_events -B build/kernel-events -A x64
cmake --build build/kernel-events --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/kernel-events -C Release --output-on-failure
```

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `kernel_events_default` | Lazy shadow objects support kernel set/reset, single waits, WaitAny and WaitAll. Direct header writes do not signal an existing shadow. |
| `kernel_events_title_kevents` | `RECOMP_TITLE_KEVENTS=1`. The table below. |

The opt-in mode additionally makes direct guest header writes authoritative:

| Check | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| An unset synchronization event times out | A zero timeout must report the state, not an error. |
| `KeSetEvent` sets it; the wait succeeds and clears `SignalState` | A synchronization wait consumes the signal, in guest memory too. |
| A second wait times out again | The same. |
| `SignalState` written to 1 by the title counts | XDK code sets and clears events by writing the header. |
| A notification event stays set across two waits | Notification events are not consumed. |
| `KeResetEvent` clears it | Host event and guest header agree. |
| WaitAny consumes only its returned index | Unselected synchronization headers remain signalled. |
| WaitAll consumes synchronization headers only on success | Timeouts preserve state; notification headers remain signalled. |
| Explicit reinitialization replaces header-event ownership | One guest address has one native shadow object. |
| Thunks consume their stdcall stack arguments | New event ordinals preserve the guest caller's stack. |

Not covered: a wait that really blocks and is released from another thread
(the bridges use a host event for exactly that, so a zero timeout checks the
same state), and any title.

The fixture also checks `KeWaitForMultipleObjects` through the dispatcher:
first access at a nonzero WaitAny index; only the selected synchronization
event being consumed; WaitAll success and timeout; header writes clearing a
stale host signal; notification persistence; failed waits preserving guest
state; and mixed header/explicitly initialized events. Every call checks
stdcall stack cleanup. Explicit events resolve in both modes; header events
remain opt-in, and the default multiple-wait rejection preserves their state.

The new multiple-wait checks fail against upstream main `193e2995` and pass
with the bridge fix. These zero-timeout tests do not establish correctness for
concurrent guest header writes, event reinitialization, abandoned mutexes, or
cross-title compatibility. Synthetic `test.xbe` is generated locally and is
not part of the contribution.

Both modes also resolve an inline semaphore on its first multiple wait and
verify that releasing two permits allows exactly two subsequent waits.

Concurrent waiter/setter races, pulse delivery to an already blocked waiter,
and real-title behavior are not established by these sequential fixtures.
